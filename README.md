# Scripts for "Drivers of Water Scarcity in Latin America and the Caribbean" (Birnbaum et al., 2022, in prep)
Insert text here describing the paper

## Purpose
A meta-repository creates a single point of access for someone to find all of the components that were used to create a published work for the purpose of reproducibility.  This repository should contain references to all minted data and software as well as house any ancillary code used to transform the source data, create figures for your publication, conduct the experiment, and / or execute the contributing software.

## Suggestions
- Don't bog down your repository with a bunch of raw data.  Instead archive and mint a DOI for your data and provide the reference in this repository with instructions for use.
- Create complete and tested documentation for how to use what is in this repository to reproduce your experiment.
